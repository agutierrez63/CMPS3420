# Name 
CMPS3420 - Dollar Tree Store 

## Description
A full stack web application project created under the supervision
of Dr. Huaqing Wang. This we application is a mock of the Dollar Tree
Store with full functionality you can expect from any online supermarket
store web application. It allows users to create and signin to accounts,
purchase goods all handled by the database. The front-end was created
using HTML, PHP, Javascript, and Bootstrap 4. The back-end was created
using Postgres or PSQL on a database server hosted by Amazon otherwiise
known as a AWS RDS. We implement the techniques we learned in our 
database class to create this web application. An invoice can also be
generated from random data pulled from the database, but it can also
fill the invoice with data parsed from purcahses made from customer
sessions.
